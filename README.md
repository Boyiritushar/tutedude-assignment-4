Code 1: Read an Existing File Successfully
Description:
This code block:

Creates a file named sample.txt and writes three lines of text to it.

Uses a try-except block to handle the case where the file might not exist, though in this case it always exists.

What it teaches:
Writing to a file using open(..., "w")

Reading a file using open(..., "r")

Using try-except to catch file-related errors.
